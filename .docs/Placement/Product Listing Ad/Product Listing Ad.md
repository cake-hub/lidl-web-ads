# Product Listing Ad

Product Listing Ads (PLA) are product ads which are shown when a user comes across a specific product, based on relevant user or keyword data.
You can choose the products you want to sponsor for certain use cases. But it is not possible to customize the products themselves with special content, unlike page banners.
